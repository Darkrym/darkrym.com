### James Northey (aka. Darkrym)

With six years of practical experience in cybersecurity, I’ve worked across a broad range of disciplines, from incident response and digital forensics to vulnerability assessments and security operations spanning both enterprise systems and operational environments.

Until recently, I worked for the Security Operations Centre supporting Australia's fourth-largest network. Where I focused heavily on large-scale monitoring, threat detection, and coordinated response efforts within complex enterprise and operational environments.

But I’m excited to share that I’ve joined Huntress. I am having a blast working with a highly skilled team, diving deeper into adversary tradecraft, analysing malware campaigns in the wild, and contributing to clean-up efforts that all have real-world impact. It’s a fast-paced environment that keeps me on my toes, perfect for someone who thrives on curiosity, continuous learning, and creative problem-solving. 

What drives me most, however, is the challenge of **malware reverse engineering**. It combines deep analysis with creative problem-solving, a space where I thrive. Each new sample is a puzzle that pushes my abilities further and further while feeding my curiosity, making it the most rewarding aspect of my work in cybersecurity.
