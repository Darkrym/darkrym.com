This space highlights a handful of personal and professional projects, from deep dives into malware internals to physical-layer tinkering, and the occasional development of tools/systems to simplify my life in a SOC. It’s a mix of discipline, obsession, and curiosity.

### My Collection of Cheat Sheets

I maintain a collection of quick-reference cheat sheets covering day-to-day tasks in security operations and reverse engineering. They're written to be direct, search-friendly, and focused on real-world tasks, not just theory. Many of these cheat sheets have been built on other people's work. I have referenced them where necessary, but please go give them some love.

### Malware Reversing Deep-dive

I spend a lot of time peeling apart malware, from packer identification and decryption routines to exploring obscure API misuse and behavioural quirks. Some efforts become full write-ups, others remain buried in folders named “why.exe” and “final_final_final_stage.ps1”.

### Home Lab Shenanigans

What started as a “low-power mini lab” spiralled into a fully racked setup with virtualisation, vlan galore, and more cable management attempts than I care to admit. Projects range from Proxmox orchestration to 3d printing mounts and segmented malware sandboxes.

### Tooling and Automation Development

I’m constantly building small scripts, tools, and pipelines, usually to streamline SOC processes, threat hunting workflows, or analysis tasks. It’s part necessity, part therapy. Selected tools may appear on GitHub when they’re not too specific to internal environments.

My **GitHub repo** for _soc-tools_ can be found [here](https://github.com/Darkrym/soc-tools/tree/main)

### Hardware Hacking Experiments

From flashing routers to tapping into debug UARTs, I’ve got a soft spot for hardware that wasn’t meant to be messed with. A lot of these side quests blur the line between electronics and security research and that’s the fun of it.

This list is just a sample the real chaos lives in notebooks, git branches, and storage bins. More to come.
