This blog is where I document my work, thoughts, and experiments across cybersecurity, reverse engineering, threat detection, and the occasional hardware rabbit hole. 

You’ll find technical deep-dives, tooling walkthroughs, cheat sheet updates, and notes from the front lines of SOC operations and malware analysis.

Most posts come from real-world experience whether it's triaging incidents, dissecting malware, or automating the boring stuff.
