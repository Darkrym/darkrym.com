This blog is where I document my work, thoughts, and experiments across cybersecurity, reverse engineering, malware analysis, and the occasional hardware rabbit hole. You'll find technical deep-dives, tooling walkthroughs, cheat sheet updates, and notes from the front lines of SOC operations and malware analysis. Most posts come from real-world experience whether it's triaging incidents, dissecting malware, or automating the boring stuff.
